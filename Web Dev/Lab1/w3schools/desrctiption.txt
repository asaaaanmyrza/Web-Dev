Hello, I decided to make a complete page using all the tutorials from ws3chools

html page title & favicon;
html div element. i used a div to wrap the contents list, basically just to group them together.
html lists. made a list with numbers and one with bullet points for the navigation and ideas.
html tables to show how i avoid tasks (like a to-do list i'll never follow).
html images. added a funny gif of a lazy student to match the vibe.
html styles(css). changed some colors, made text bold or italic, and added a background color.
html comments. added a hidden note for laughs
html quotation. used to add a funny procrostination quote
